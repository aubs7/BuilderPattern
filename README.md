# E-Commerce Application (Creating User Accounts
Background: You're tasked with developing an e-commerce application where customers create accounts with varying levels of detail. Yet, using standard constructor give you 3 challenges

    1. Registration forms: It's cumbersome to ensure users enter all fields in the correct order, leading to errors and frustration.
    2. Optional fields: Not all customers provide complete information, but the constructor forces them to.
    3. Data consistency: Changes to user profiles after registration can cause unexpected issues due to mutable fields.

Using the Builder Pattern can address this issue.
